# Simple networked simulation application:

By [Alberto Fustinoni](http://aftnet.net)

Use file menu to host a simulation or to connect a server running one.
On the server, keys WASD can be used to move the user controlled marble around; 
clients run a parallel simulation kept in sync to the server's but allow no user interaction.

Executable file includes all resources and is standalone; requires at least Windows XP for operation. 
(might work with Windows 2000 but hasn't been tested)

Only one server can be run on a machine at any given time; as many clients as wanted can be run on a machine,
even if it is also running a server.
No support whatsoever for DNS resolving, when connecting to a server input its IP address.
